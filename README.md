# tic-tac-toe
simple tic tac toe with single player and multiplayer mode
This was made as project for C programming subject by me and 3 other friends.
It has several exciting features like game status display that counts the winning of every player and even shows the count of draw and cancelled game.
Has inbuilt ad displaying feature too.
